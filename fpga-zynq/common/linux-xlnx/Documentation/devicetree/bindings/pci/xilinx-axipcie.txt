* Xilinx AXI PCIe Root Port Bridge

Required properties:
- #address-cells: Address representation for root ports, set to <3>
- #size-cells: Size representation for root ports, set to <2>
- compatible: Should be "xlnx,axi-pcie-1.05.a"
- interrupts: Should contain AXI PCIe interrupts.
- reg: Should contain AXI PCIe registers location and length.
- ranges: ranges for the PCI memory regions (I/O space region is noti
	supported by hardware)
	Please refer to the standard PCI bus binding document for a more
	detailed explanation
- xlnx,include-rc: Tells whether configured for Root Port (=1) or
	End Point(=0)
- xlnx,pciebar-num: Number of PCIe to AXI BARs configured in HW.
- xlnx,pciebar2axibar-0: Translates address from PCIe to AXI, BAR 0.
- xlnx,pciebar2axibar-1: Translates address from PCIe to AXI, BAR 1. If
	not configured in hardware it should be set to all FF's.

Optional properties:
- xlnx,device-num: Tells the instance of AXI PCIe IP.
