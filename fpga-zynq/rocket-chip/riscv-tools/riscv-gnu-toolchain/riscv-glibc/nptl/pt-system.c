/* libpthread once had its own 'system', though there was no apparent
   reason for it.  There is no use in having a separate symbol in
   libpthread, but the historical ABI requires it.  For static linking,
   there is no need to provide anything here--the libc version will be
   linked in.  For shared library ABI compatibility, there must be a
   'system' symbol in libpthread.so; so we define it using IFUNC to
   redirect to the libc function.  */
