USB Blaster Cheap Clone
=======================

The Altera USB Blaster has a cheap clone, based on :
 - a Cypress CY7C68013A-56PVXC as the main chip
 - a 74HC244D as the output latch
 - a 24 MHz quartz
 - a EEPROM 24C64BN

The schematics (cut down to essential) is :

From this one can deduce that :
 - the cypress emulates the Altera chip
 - as the cypress pins used are 41-47, all output/input are controlled by 8051
   PortA.
 - as the 8051 is clocked at 24Mhz, and because each USB byte is handled by the
   8051, assuming a 40 instruction cycles per USB packet, the maximum throughput
   would be around 500 kHz.

Pinout
======
 Port A.0: nOE (output enable of 74HC244D)
 Port A.1: TDI
 Port A.5: TMS
 Port A.6: TDO
 Port A.7: TCK

Throughput considerations
=========================
Mesurements on a scope reveal that :
 - for bitbang mode, the throughtput is 56.5 kbits/s
   (as each clock transition is mesured at 17.7us)
 - for byteshift mode, the throughput is 107.7 kbits/s
   (as 63 bits TDI transmission is mesured in 585 us)

Let's suppose that to upload a 32 bits value, it is necessary to :
 - move from IDLE to DR-SHIFT : 3 bitbang (3 TMS transitions)
 - input the 32 bits of data : 1 byteshift (24 bits) + 8 bitbang (8 bits)
 - move from DR-SHIFT to IDLE : 5 bitbang (5 TMS transitions)
So for this 32 bits of data, the time would be :
   3 * 17.7us + 1 * 585us/63*24 + 5 * 17.7us
 = 53.1us + 222us + 88.5us
 = 363us

Throughtput in bit/s: 32 * (1 / 363E-6) = 88000 bits/s
Throughtput in bytes/s: 11kBytes/s

Conclusion
==========
Contrary to the original USB Blaster, the cheap clone will never reach high
transfer speeds over JTAG.
