// An RWMutex is a reader/writer mutual exclusion lock.

// RWMutexes can be created as part of other structures;
// the zero value for a RWMutex is an unlocked mutex.
//
// An RWMutex must not be copied after first use.
//
// If a goroutine holds a RWMutex for reading, it must not expect this or any
// other goroutine to be able to also take the read lock until the first read
// lock is released. In particular, this prohibits recursive read locking.
// This is to ensure that the lock eventually becomes available;
// a blocked Lock call excludes new readers from acquiring the lock.
