This is a series of scripts to enable one to import into MySQL the
output of a test run, and then graph the data. These scripts will
likely require modification for different setups, which is why they're
in 'contrib' instead of DejaGnu.


sum2xml.sh
----------
	This script takes a standard DejaGnu .sum file, and converts
	it to the XML format. Ideally the --xml option to runtest
	should be used, but this is useful for importing historical
	data.

create-db.sql
-------------
	This is an SQL input file to create the tables used for this
	database. This assumes the 'dejagnu' database has been
	created, but is empty.

importxml.sh
------------
	This script imports the XML file into MySQL and populates the
	tables with data.

make-datafile.sh
----------------
	This script does an SQL query in the 'dejagnu' database, and
	produces the data files that get used for graphing. This is
	oriented towards GNU toolchain testing, and is probably the
	main this any other user would need to modify for their
	application. Currently the created data files are one for each
	architecture.

plot.sh
-------
	This script reads the data files produced by make-datafile.sh,
	and produces a command file for gnuplot, which then makes the
	chart.
