/** @page primerdocs OpenOCD Documentation Primers

This page provides an introduction to OpenOCD's documentation processes.

OpenOCD presently produces several kinds of documentation:
- The User's Guide:
  - Focuses on using the OpenOCD software.
  - Details the installation, usage, and customization.
  - Provides descriptions of public Jim/TCL script commands.
  - Written using GNU texinfo.
  - Created with 'make pdf' or 'make html'.
  - See @subpage primertexinfo and @ref styletexinfo.
- The References: (as proposed)
  - Focuses on using specific hardware with OpenOCD.
  - Details the supported interfaces, chips, boards, and targets.
  - Provides overview, usage, reference, and FAQ for each device.
  - Written using LaTeX language with custom macros.
  - Created with 'make references'.
  - See @subpage primerlatex and @ref stylelatex.
- The Manual:
  - Focuses on developing the OpenOCD software.
  - Details the architecutre, driver interfaces, and processes.
  - Provides "full" coverage of C source code (work-in-progress).
  - Written using Doxygen C language conventions (i.e. in comments).
  - Created with 'make doxygen'.
  - See @subpage primerdoxygen and @ref styledoxygen.

The following sections provide more information for anyone that wants to
contribute new or updated documentation to the OpenOCD project.

/** @page primertexinfo Texinfo Primer

The OpenOCD User's Guide presently exists entirely within the
doc/openocd.texi document.  That file contains documentation with
mark-up suitable for being parsed by the GNU Texinfo utilities
(http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/).

When you add a new command, driver, or driver option, it needs to be
documented in the User's Guide.  Use the existing documentation for
models, but feel free to make better use of Texinfo mechanisms.  See
the Texinfo web site for the Texinfo manual and more information.

OpenOCD style guidelines for Texinfo documentation can be found on the
@ref styletexinfo page.

/** @page primerlatex LaTeX Primer

The OpenOCD project provides a number of reference guides using the
LaTeX typesetting language.

- OpenOCD Quick Reference Sheets
- OpenOCD Hardware Reference Guides

These documents have not yet been produced, so this Primer serves as
a placeholder to describe how they are created and can be extended.
The same holds true for the @ref stylelatex page.

/** @page primerdoxygen Doxygen Primer

Doxygen-style comments are used to provide documentation in-line with
the OpenOCD source code.  These comments are used to document functions,
variables, structs, enums, fields, and everything else that might need
to be documented for developers.  Additional files containing comments
that supplement the code comments in order to provide complete developer
documentation.

Even if you already know Doxygen, please read this Primer to learn
how OpenOCD developers already use Doxygen features in the project tree.
For more information about OpenOCD's required style for using Doxygen,
see the @ref styledoxygen page and look at existing documentation in the
@c doc/manual tree.

@section primerdoxytext Doxygen Input Files

Doxygen has been configured parse all of the C source code files (*.c
and *.h) in @c src/ in order to produce a complete reference of all
OpenOCD project symbols.  In addition to the source code files, other
files will also be scanned for comment blocks; some are referenced
explicitly by the @c INPUT variable in the Doxygen configuration file.

By default, the Doxygen configuration enables a "full" set of features,
including generation of dependency graphs (using the GraphViz package).
These features may be disabled by editing the @c Doxyfile.in file at the
top of the project tree; the configuration file includes comments that
provide detailed documentation for each option.

To support out-of-tree building of the documentation, the @c Doxyfile.in
@c INPUT values will have all instances of the string @c "@srcdir@"
replaced with the current value of the make variable
<code>$(srcdir)</code>.  The Makefile uses a rule to convert
@c Doxyfile.in into the @c Doxyfile used by <code>make doxygen</code>.

@section primerdoxyoocd OpenOCD Input Files

OpenOCD uses the @c INPUT mechanism to include additional documentation to
provide The Manual for OpenOCD Developers.  These extra files contain
high-level information intended to supplement the relatively low-level
documentation that gets extracted from the source code comments.

OpenOCD's Doxygen configuration file will search for all @c .txt files
that can be found under the @c doc/manual directory in the project tree.
New files containing valid Doxygen markup that are placed in or under
that directory will be detected and included in The Manual automatically.

@section primerdoxyman Doxygen Reference Manual

The full documentation for Doxygen can be referenced on-line at the project
home page: http://www.doxygen.org/index.html.  In HTML versions of this
document, an image with a link to this site appears in the page footer.
