Xilinx AXI CDMA engine, it does transfers between memory and memory

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "xlnx,axi-cdma"
- reg: Should contain CDMA registers location and length.

Option node properties:
- xlnx,include-sg: Tells whether configured for Scatter-mode in
	the hardware.

Required child node properties:
- interrupts: Should contain channel CDMA interrupts.
- xlnx,data-width: Should contain the stream data width, take values
	{32,64...1024}.
- xlnx,device-id: Should contain device number in each channel. It should be
	{0,1,2...so on} to the number of CDMA devices configured in hardware.

Optional child node properties:
- xlnx,include-dre: Tells whether hardware is configured for Data
	Realignment Engine.
- xlnx,lite-mode: Tells whether CDMA lite mode is configured in HW.
- xlnx,max-burst-len: Should contain maximum burst length configured in the
	HW. It is only valid if configured for lite mode.
